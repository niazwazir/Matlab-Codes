%construct is the standards form/method that we use to describe the algorithms.
% The construct used to build algorithms can be described in a 
%special way called pseudocode (p-code).
%Pseduocode is a hybrid mixture of MATLAB command and english
%Separate line is written for each distinct idea or segment
%EXAMPLE: Write a pseudocode for a MATLAB program which converts
%temperature from degree Fahrenheit to kelvins
%prompt user to enter temperature in degree Fahrenheit
%Read temperature in degree Fahrenheit (TF)
%Temperature in Kelvin TK----(5/9)*(TF-32)+273.15
%Write temperature in Kelvins
%So this is the called as Pseudo Code
